# CrazyGames x GameMaker Web Jam

**Theme:** ONE CHANCE

---

## Overview

You play as a hacker facing a virus invasion. The player has an in-game *rulebook/manual* and must identify and send the correct code to neutralize each threat. The game blends puzzle and point-and-click mechanics with a terminal-style interface — and the player only gets one chance per threat (wrong decisions have consequences).

Jam focus: prototype with 3–5 types of threats, terminal interface with limited "tabs," and copy/paste mechanics from the manual into the input field.

## Core Mechanics

* **Genre:** point-and-click / interface-based puzzle.
* **Copy/Paste mechanic:** player clicks *highlighted* text to copy it; then clicks on an input field to paste automatically. Used for selecting codes, keywords, or manual references.
* **Tabs/Programs:** terminal has programs as windows (Manual, Inbox/Email, Input Field, Tutorial). Open/close by clicking tab at bottom. Only **2 windows visible at once** (each half-screen). To open a 3rd, one must be closed.
* **Resource limitation:** only one code can be sent at a time. Some codes/items can handle multiple threats at once.

---

## Programs (terminal windows)

* **Manual** — contains symptoms and matching codes. Example: *Symptom:* screen goes dark → *Code:* 1234.
* **Input Field** — where symptoms arrive in real time and where player pastes/enters the code.
* **Email/Inbox** — objectives, tips, or special items are received here.
* **Tutorial** — an image/GIF explaining the copy/paste mechanic.
